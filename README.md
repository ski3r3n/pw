# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In our class, we observed that many students struggled to understand and subsequently review the material taught. To address this, we are developing an audio-to-notes converter. This tool will use an audio recorder to capture the teacher's lectures and employ artificial intelligence to transform them into comprehensive notes.
在斯文求学之路上，我们察觉到众多学子在吸收与回顾课堂所授之知识时似乎步履维艰。为破解此难题，吾等策划并研发了一项创新科技 —— 乐克特智：智能讲课笔记转换系统，借助先进的人工智能技术，将授课音频精妙转化为详尽笔记。
Challenge 挑战识别: Students face difficulties in rapidly and accurately grasping the content delivered by teachers during lectures. 学生在迅速且准确地掌握教师课堂讲授内容方面遇到难题。
Solution 智能解决方案: Development of an artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to create simple and concise summaries or notes of classroom teachings. 开发一款利用人工智能为课堂教学内容创建简明扼要笔记或总结的系统。
Process Overview 流程概览:
Recording (录音阶段): Capturing the lecture through an audio recording. 利用录音设备捕捉教师的讲课声音。
AI Transcription (AI转录): Converting the recording into text using advanced AI algorithms. 通过先进的人工智能算法，将录音内容转换成文本。
Summarization (概要制作): Employing the ChatGPT API to generate a clear and succinct summary of the transcribed text, making the key points of the lecture easily accessible and understandable for students.  应用ChatGPT API对转录文本进行精炼，生成清晰简洁的课堂要点总结，使学生易于理解并掌握关键信息。
